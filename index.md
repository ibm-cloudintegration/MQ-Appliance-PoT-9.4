**IBM MQ Appliance Proof of Technology Overview?**

Proof of Technology sessions are complimentary classes to build
understanding of IBM technology and software with practical
presentations and hands-on lab exercises. 

**Introduction**

The IBM MQ Appliance provides a simplified messaging solution by combining many of the benefits of IBM MQ with those of a physical appliance. Like IBM MQ, the IBM MQ Appliance provides a rapid, reliable, security-rich infrastructure, but unlike IBM MQ, it combines software with hardware. Deployable in less than 30 minutes, the IBM MQ Appliance saves customers from having to build their own servers, or needing extensive local MQ expertise when they deploy to partners or remote locations.

The IBM MQ Appliance has the following benefits:

* Seamless integration: integrates with existing MQ networks and clusters

* Simple, out-of-the-box High Availability: with paired connectivity to another appliance, delivering personalized role-based monitoring and configuration

* Simple, out-of-the-box Disaster Recovery: with flexible topologies and use cases making adding DR easy

* MQ Console: a browser-based user interface, offering personalized role-based monitoring and configuration

* Simpler maintenance: fix packs delivered as certified firmware updates onto a locked-down appliance, updating the hardare firmware, OS, and MQ all at once

* Maximum performance out-of-the-box: pre-optimized with no tuning or additional configuration needed

* Customers can choose between two appliances, according to the needs of their business:<br>
    
    1) IBM MQ Appliance M2003A: A high-end solution for enterprise use

    2) IBM MQ Appliance M2003B: Lower-end solution for smaller needs or great for branch office or factory deployments
